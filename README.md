### Overview

A nutcracker-themed web page populated with buttons that, when clicked on, generate gifs on the page. The buttons run a search query to the giphy API, producing a table of gifs that will pause or play when the user clicks them. You may also add topic-buttons of your choice, using the text-input field to the left, to generate your own queries. Give it a try!

### How to use

* Click any of the nutcracker-themed buttons to get your gifs

* Click on any of the gifs to pause or play

* Click-away! Happy gifing!!
